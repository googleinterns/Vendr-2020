# Street vendor application [STEP]

This repo contains the street vendor application.
This work is based on the [Google Software Product Sprint](https://g.co/softwareproductsprint) program.

The objective of this project is to connect street vendors that are close to potential customers by creating a platform that allows them to publish their businesses information and update it dynamically. We want potential buyers to compare and select between street vendors to find the ones that fit their needs at their best. To achieve this, the platform will provide working hours, description, image gallery, contact information, location and the distance from the user if delivery service is available.
